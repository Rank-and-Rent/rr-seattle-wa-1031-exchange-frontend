Triple net lease real estate is real property held for investment, so it qualifies as like-kind replacement property under Internal Revenue Code Section 1031, which now applies exclusively to real property since the 2017 tax law changes removed personal property from eligibility. The exchange defers, rather than eliminates, the capital gains and depreciation recapture tax owed on your relinquished property, and NNN assets are commonly used for that purpose because their long-term leases and corporate guarantees make cash flow easier to underwrite quickly inside the forty-five day window.",

We read every renewal option in the lease, confirm whether rent bumps are fixed or tied to an index, and flag any co-tenancy or exclusive use clauses that could affect renewal likelihood.

        answer:
          "You can identify any number of properties, without the three-property limit, as long as the combined fair market value of everything identified does not exceed two hundred percent of what you sold. We track valuations carefully so your ${PRIMARY_CITY}, ${PRIMARY_STATE_ABBR} identification letter stays within that threshold rather than accidentally disqualifying the exchange.",

        question: "Can I change identified properties after the letter is submitted?",
        answer:
          "You can revise the list at any point before the forty-five day window closes; only the identifications in place at day forty-five are binding. We keep backup options documented and ready so you remain confident if a property changes status or falls out of contract before the deadline.",

          "We compile the strongest available evidence, which may include a recent appraisal, a broker's opinion of value, or an executed purchase contract, so your valuation support satisfies both your intermediary's documentation standards and what would hold up under IRS scrutiny if the exchange were ever examined.",

      {
        question: "What happens if I do not identify any replacement property within forty-five days?",
        answer:
          "The exchange fails entirely, and the sale of your relinquished property is treated as a normal taxable sale, triggering capital gains tax and depreciation recapture on the full realized gain. There is no partial credit for having identified late, which is why we build in a buffer well before the actual deadline rather than planning to submit on day forty-five itself.",
      },
      {
        question: "Does identifying a property mean I am legally obligated to buy it?",
        answer:
          "No. Identification is a notice requirement to your intermediary, not a purchase contract. You are only bound by whatever purchase agreement you separately sign with the seller, and identifying a property that later falls through is not itself a violation, as long as you still close on a qualifying property within one hundred eighty days if you want the exchange to succeed.",

        question: "Do the identification rules change based on Washington's tax structure?",

Washington's lack of a state income tax and its real estate exclusion from the capital gains excise tax do not alter these federal timing requirements in any way.",

We identify which party bears roof, structure, and parking lot obligations, confirm any active warranty status, and estimate remaining useful life on major building systems, so you can budget accurately for a net lease property in ${PRIMARY_CITY}, ${PRIMARY_STATE_ABBR} rather than assuming an absolute triple net lease covers everything.",

          "Yes. We compare current contractual rent against prevailing market rent and, where available, tenant sales performance, to evaluate the likely renewal rent target within the relevant ${PRIMARY_CITY}, ${PRIMARY_STATE_ABBR} trade area, which helps you understand whether a renewal is likely to preserve, increase, or reduce your cash flow.",

Holding the property and continuing to depreciate it defers that recapture further, and another 1031 exchange at your eventual sale can defer it again, which is why many net lease investors plan to keep exchanging rather than ever selling outright.",

A fee simple ownership interest in land subject to a ground lease you granted to a tenant also qualifies, since you are exchanging real property for real property either way. We confirm which side of the transaction you hold before treating any ground lease structure as qualifying.",

        question: "What happens to my depreciation if I own only the land under a ground lease?",
        answer:
          "Land itself is not depreciable, so if you own fee simple land subject to a ground lease and the tenant owns the improvements, your income is largely ground rent with no depreciation deduction against it. This changes the return profile compared with owning a depreciable building, and we walk through that trade-off explicitly before recommending a ground lease acquisition.",

        question: "Are ground lease rent resets typically favorable to the landowner over time?",
        answer:
          "It depends entirely on the reset mechanism in the specific lease. Fixed-percentage bumps can fall behind market appreciation over a long term, while periodic fair-market-value resets or appraisal-based mechanisms tend to track the market more closely but introduce negotiation risk at each reset date.

We benchmark proposed rent against comparable market leases specifically to catch this before you overpay for the real estate.",

        answer:
          "Yes, as long as it is held for investment or for use in a trade or business, rather than for personal use, such as a future personal residence lot. Raw land and improved real estate are both treated as real property under the current like-kind standard, so we confirm intended use and holding purpose align with exchange requirements before recommending a parcel.",

        question: "Does holding raw land satisfy the 1031 requirement to use the property productively?",

          "Yes. Section 1031 requires the property be held for investment or for productive use in a trade or business, and holding raw land for appreciation is generally accepted as investment use, even without current income. What disqualifies land is holding it primarily for personal use or as inventory for immediate resale, which is treated differently, similar to a property developer's spec inventory.",

          "Because land is not depreciable, exchanging from an improved, depreciating property into raw land means you stop generating depreciation deductions during the hold period, even though the gain deferral continues to apply. We walk through this trade-off explicitly, since some investors are comfortable pausing depreciation in exchange for a lower-maintenance holding, while others prefer to keep depreciation flowing through an income-producing asset.",

An interest in a partnership or an LLC taxed as a partnership is treated as personal property, an interest in the entity rather than in the underlying real estate, and generally does not qualify, even though the entity itself owns real property.

    summary:
      `The forty-five day identification period is the first of two federal deadlines that govern every deferred 1031 exchange, and it is unforgiving. The clock starts the day after your relinquished ${PRIMARY_CITY}, ${PRIMARY_STATE_ABBR} property closes escrow, not the day you sign a listing agreement or accept an offer, and it runs on calendar days, including weekends and federal holidays. By midnight of day forty-five, you must deliver a written identification to your qualified intermediary that unambiguously describes each candidate replacement property, typically by street address or legal description. There is no informal grace period, and verbal identification to a broker or attorney does not satisfy the requirement. Three counting methods govern how many properties you may name. Under the three-property rule, you may identify up to three properties of any combined value, which is the method most single-asset exchanges use. Under the two hundred percent rule, you may identify more than three properties as long as their combined fair market value does not exceed two hundred percent of what you sold your relinquished property for. Under the ninety-five percent rule, you may identify an unlimited number of properties regardless of combined value, but you must actually acquire at least ninety-five percent of that combined value by the end of the exchange, a threshold few investors choose to accept given the execution risk. Missing all three tests, even by identifying a fourth property one dollar over the two hundred percent ceiling, can disqualify the entire exchange and convert it into a fully taxable sale. Because ${PRIMARY_CITY} and greater Puget Sound inventory can move quickly, investors who wait until week five to start underwriting replacement candidates frequently run out of runway. We recommend building a working list of qualifying assets before the relinquished property even closes, so the written identification is a formality rather than a scramble. The Internal Revenue Service has granted narrow extensions in federally declared disaster areas, but absent that relief, the forty-five day window does not move, regardless of financing delays, inspection contingencies, or a seller who backs out at day forty. One point worth clarifying: a taxpayer may revoke and resubmit an identification as many times as needed before midnight of day forty-five, so an early, imperfect list is far safer than waiting until the last day to submit a single, final version. Once the deadline passes, however, the list is frozen, and even an obvious clerical error, such as a transposed unit number, generally cannot be corrected after the fact. Consulting with your qualified intermediary about the exact wording standard they require, since some accept a signed fax or email while others require a specific form, is a small step that avoids an entirely avoidable disqualification.`,

    summary:
      `The one hundred eighty day deadline is the second and final federal clock in a deferred 1031 exchange, and it determines the absolute last day you may close on replacement property. The period begins on the same day as the forty-five day identification period, meaning it starts the calendar day after your relinquished ${PRIMARY_CITY}, ${PRIMARY_STATE_ABBR} property transfers, and it runs for one hundred eighty calendar days from that point, not one hundred eighty business days. The two periods overlap rather than stack, so the identification window is simply the first checkpoint inside the larger closing window. There is a second, less understood limit layered on top of the one hundred eighty day count: your exchange period actually ends on the earlier of day one hundred eighty or the due date, including extensions, of your federal income tax return for the year the relinquished property was sold. For an investor who closes a relinquished property in late autumn, the standard April filing deadline can arrive well before day one hundred eighty, silently shortening the exchange window unless the taxpayer files for a filing extension. This is one of the most common and costly oversights in exchange planning, since a taxpayer who files a timely return without an extension before the exchange concludes may inadvertently truncate their own exchange period. Like the identification period, the one hundred eighty day deadline runs on calendar days and does not pause for weekends, holidays, financing contingencies, or a replacement property falling out of contract at the last moment. If the seller of your identified replacement property cannot close before day one hundred eighty, the transaction simply fails as an exchange, the qualified intermediary releases the held proceeds, and the transfer is taxed as an ordinary sale in the year the funds are received. Because closing timelines in ${PRIMARY_CITY} and the broader Puget Sound market can be affected by title, lender, and inspection contingencies like anywhere else, we advise building meaningful buffer time into any replacement property contract rather than scheduling a closing for day one hundred seventy eight. A same-day close, where the relinquished property sale and the replacement property purchase settle on the same calendar date, is not required and is in fact uncommon; most exchanges span weeks or months between the two closings, with the one hundred eighty day figure representing the outer boundary rather than a target. Investors sometimes assume the deadline is measured in business days because so many other real estate timelines are, and that single assumption is responsible for more missed exchange deadlines than any other misunderstanding we encounter.`,

    summary:
      `Boot is the term the Internal Revenue Code uses for any value an exchanger receives in a 1031 transaction that is not like-kind real property, and receiving boot is the most common way an otherwise valid exchange still generates a partial tax bill. Boot comes in a few recognizable forms. Cash boot is the most direct: any net cash that lands in your hands or remains unspent in your qualified intermediary account at the close of the exchange is taxable, even if the rest of the transaction is a clean like-kind exchange. Mortgage boot, sometimes called debt relief boot, arises when the debt paid off on your relinquished property exceeds the debt placed on your replacement property, without an offsetting cash contribution on your part; the Internal Revenue Service treats a net reduction in liability the same way it treats receiving cash, because you have effectively been relieved of an obligation without reinvesting an equivalent amount. A less common form involves non-like-kind property received alongside real property, though this occurs infrequently since the 2017 changes to the tax code narrowed eligible exchange property to real property alone. The core planning principle to avoid boot is straightforward even if the mechanics are not: your replacement property should be equal to or greater in both value and debt than your relinquished property, and you should reinvest all of your net exchange proceeds rather than pulling any cash out at closing. Boot is not necessarily taxed dollar for dollar against the total boot received; instead, gain is recognized to the lesser of the boot received or your total realized gain on the transaction, so an investor with modest built-in gain may owe less tax on a given amount of boot than an investor with substantial appreciation. For ${PRIMARY_CITY}, ${PRIMARY_STATE_ABBR} investors trading up from an appreciated asset, the practical risk usually shows up as inadvertent mortgage boot, where a seller pays off a larger loan on the relinquished property than the new lender is willing to place on the replacement property, and the gap between the two is not covered with additional cash. We walk clients through a debt and equity reconciliation before any offer is signed specifically to catch this exposure early, since discovering mortgage boot at the closing table leaves little room to fix it. Ordinary transaction costs such as brokerage commissions, escrow fees, and title insurance premiums are generally treated as reducing the amount realized on the sale rather than as boot, but costs unrelated to the transaction itself, including expenses that are not properly characterized as exchange expenses, can be treated differently, so keeping a clean, itemized closing statement matters for both your qualified intermediary and your tax preparer.`,

    slug: "the-qualified-intermediary-role",
    headline: "The role a qualified intermediary plays in every deferred exchange",
    summary:
      `A qualified intermediary, often called a QI or accommodator, is the independent party that stands between your relinquished property sale and your replacement property purchase so that you never take actual or constructive receipt of your own exchange proceeds. Receipt of funds by the taxpayer, even briefly, is generally what disqualifies an exchange under the governing Treasury regulations, so the safe harbor role the qualified intermediary occupies is not a convenience, it is the mechanism that makes deferral possible at all. Before your relinquished property closes, you enter into a written exchange agreement with the qualified intermediary that assigns your rights in the sale contract to them. At closing, sale proceeds are wired directly to the qualified intermediary and held, typically in a segregated or qualified escrow or trust account, until they are needed to acquire the replacement property. The qualified intermediary also prepares the assignment documents for the replacement property purchase contract and disburses funds directly to the closing table when that transaction closes, again without the funds ever passing through the taxpayer's hands. Not just anyone can serve in this role. Treasury regulations disqualify certain parties from acting as your qualified intermediary, including your attorney, accountant, real estate agent, or employee, if that person or firm has acted as your agent in a professional capacity within the two years preceding the exchange. This disqualified person rule exists to prevent someone with an existing fiduciary relationship to you from also controlling your exchange funds, which the Internal Revenue Service views as too close to constructive receipt. Because qualified intermediaries hold significant sums of client money, often for weeks at a time, the selection of a reputable firm matters a great deal; the industry has seen isolated but serious cases of qualified intermediary insolvency or fraud, so investors should confirm fidelity bonding, errors and omissions insurance, and how client funds are segregated before signing an exchange agreement. For ${PRIMARY_CITY}, ${PRIMARY_STATE_ABBR} investors, we help coordinate the qualified intermediary selection and documentation process alongside your closing attorney or escrow officer, while making clear that we do not serve as the qualified intermediary ourselves and always introduce you to an independent, licensed provider for that function. Many qualified intermediaries hold client funds in a qualified escrow account or a qualified trust structured under the applicable Treasury regulations, and some states impose their own licensing or bonding requirements on top of the federal framework, so a provider experienced with your specific transaction type and property location is generally preferable to the lowest-cost option available. Ask any prospective qualified intermediary how long they have operated, whether they carry a fidelity bond specifically covering client exchange funds, and whether that coverage amount is adequate relative to the size of your transaction, since general business insurance is not the same protection.`,

    summary:
      `Like-kind property is the foundational eligibility test for a 1031 exchange, and the definition changed meaningfully under the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, which took effect for exchanges completed after December 31, 2017. Before that change, personal property such as aircraft, equipment, franchise licenses, and vehicles could sometimes qualify for exchange treatment alongside real property. Since the change, only real property held for productive use in a trade or business or for investment is eligible; personal property exchanges no longer qualify under Section 1031 at all. Within real property, however, the like-kind standard is intentionally broad. Real property is generally considered like-kind to any other real property, regardless of grade, quality, or improvement level, as long as both the relinquished and replacement assets are held for business or investment purposes rather than personal use. This means an investor can exchange raw, unimproved land for a stabilized apartment building, or a single retail pad for an industrial warehouse, or a medical office building for a portfolio of net-leased retail assets, all within the same exchange, provided the underlying use test is satisfied on both ends. What disqualifies a property is not its type but its purpose. A primary residence does not qualify, because it is not held for business or investment use. Property held primarily for sale, sometimes called dealer property, such as a fix-and-flip renovation or a subdivided lot inventory held by a builder, also does not qualify, because it is treated as stock in trade rather than an investment asset. Geography carries a limit as well: real property located within the United States is not considered like-kind to real property located outside the United States, so a foreign property cannot serve as either the relinquished or replacement side of a domestic exchange. For ${PRIMARY_CITY}, ${PRIMARY_STATE_ABBR} investors, this breadth is genuinely useful, since it allows a single-family rental portfolio to convert into commercial real estate, or a Puget Sound multifamily holding to convert into out-of-state industrial property, without the exchange failing on a like-kind technicality, so long as both properties are held for qualifying business or investment purposes. Mixed-use properties, where a portion of the building is owner-occupied and a portion is leased to tenants, add a layer of nuance, since only the business or investment portion of the property typically qualifies for exchange treatment, and the owner-occupied portion generally does not. Vacation or second homes occupy a similarly gray area; the Internal Revenue Service has issued safe harbor guidance describing rental usage and limited personal use thresholds that, if satisfied for a sustained period before and after the exchange, can support treating a vacation property as held for investment rather than personal use.`,

    headline: "How a reverse 1031 exchange lets you buy before you sell",
    summary:
      `A reverse exchange flips the usual order of a 1031 transaction, allowing an investor to acquire replacement property before the relinquished property has sold, which matters in a competitive market where a desirable asset will not wait for your existing property to close. The Internal Revenue Service does not permit a taxpayer to simply hold title to both properties at once and call it an exchange; instead, reverse exchanges rely on a safe harbor structure set out in Revenue Procedure 2000-37, using an independent Exchange Accommodation Titleholder, commonly called an EAT, to temporarily hold title to one of the two properties. Two structures are common. In an exchange-first, or true reverse, structure, the EAT takes and holds title to the replacement property while the taxpayer arranges the sale of the relinquished property. In an exchange-last structure, the EAT instead takes title to the relinquished property while the taxpayer closes on the replacement property directly, then the EAT sells the parked relinquished property once a buyer is secured. Both structures are bound by the same one hundred eighty day limit on how long the EAT may hold parked title, and the forty-five day identification requirement still applies, though in a reverse exchange it applies to identifying the relinquished property being sold rather than the replacement property, since the replacement side has already been acquired. Because the EAT structure requires the investor, or a lender on the investor's behalf, to fund the acquisition of the replacement property before relinquished property proceeds are available, reverse exchanges typically require more available capital or bridge financing than a standard forward exchange, and lenders experienced with parked-title arrangements are not universal, so financing needs to be arranged early. For a ${PRIMARY_CITY}, ${PRIMARY_STATE_ABBR} investor who has identified a strong replacement asset in a market where offers move quickly, a reverse exchange can be the difference between securing that property and losing it to a buyer who does not need to coordinate a simultaneous sale, but the structure carries meaningfully higher transaction costs and documentation complexity than a standard exchange, so it is worth evaluating that tradeoff early with your qualified intermediary and lender. The Exchange Accommodation Titleholder is typically a special-purpose entity, often a single-member limited liability company formed specifically to hold parked title, and its formation, insurance, and eventual dissolution all add legal cost on top of the qualified intermediary's standard fee. Lenders vary considerably in their comfort with parked-title arrangements, and some conventional lenders decline to finance a property held by an accommodation entity altogether, which is why early conversations with a lender familiar with reverse exchange structures tend to save the most time. Investors weighing a reverse exchange against simply waiting to sell first should also account for the carrying cost of holding two properties, even briefly, including any bridge loan interest, since that cost offsets some of the benefit of securing the replacement property early.`,

    slug: "improvement-build-to-suit-exchange",
    headline: "How an improvement or build-to-suit exchange applies proceeds to construction",
    summary:
      `An improvement exchange, sometimes called a construction or build-to-suit exchange, allows an investor to use exchange proceeds not just to purchase replacement real estate but to fund improvements to that property before the exchange concludes. This structure is useful when the ideal replacement asset is not a finished, stabilized property but raw land that needs a building constructed on it, or an existing structure that needs substantial renovation to match the value of the relinquished property being sold. Because a taxpayer cannot simply take title to replacement property and then use exchange funds to improve an asset they already own without running into constructive receipt problems, improvement exchanges rely on the same Exchange Accommodation Titleholder safe harbor used in reverse exchanges. The EAT takes and holds title to the replacement property while construction or renovation proceeds, using exchange funds released by the qualified intermediary to pay contractors and cover project costs, and title transfers to the taxpayer only once the improvements are complete or the exchange period runs out, whichever comes first. This creates the defining constraint of an improvement exchange: every dollar of value you want credited toward your replacement property, including the value of improvements, must be in place by the time title transfers, which in practice must happen within the one hundred eighty day exchange period. Improvements promised for a future date, or construction that is only partially complete when the parking period ends, do not count toward the exchange value; only what has actually been built and is part of the real property at the time of transfer is recognized. This makes timeline discipline critical, since most substantial construction projects take considerably longer than one hundred eighty days to complete from a standing start, so successful improvement exchanges typically involve properties where construction can realistically be substantially finished within that window, or where site work and initial phases were already planned before the exchange began. For ${PRIMARY_CITY}, ${PRIMARY_STATE_ABBR} investors considering ground-up construction or major renovation as a replacement strategy, we help evaluate whether a project's realistic construction timeline fits within the one hundred eighty day constraint before recommending this structure over a simpler forward exchange. Site work that begins before the exchange formally starts, such as permitting, grading, or utility work completed under separate ownership, can shorten the amount of construction that still needs to happen inside the one hundred eighty day window, which is one reason experienced sponsors sometimes begin preliminary site preparation on a parcel they intend to acquire through an improvement exchange well before the relinquished property has even gone to market.`,

    headline: "How related-party rules affect a 1031 exchange between family members or affiliated entities",
    summary:
      `Section 1031(f) of the tax code imposes special restrictions when an exchange occurs between related parties, and the rule exists specifically to prevent families and affiliated entities from using a 1031 exchange to quietly cash out appreciated property while claiming deferral. Related parties are defined by attribution rules borrowed from other sections of the tax code, generally covering close family members such as siblings, spouses, ancestors, and descendants, along with entities where the taxpayer holds a significant ownership interest above the thresholds set out in those attribution rules. When a taxpayer exchanges property with a related party, both parties are required to hold the property they received in the exchange for at least two years following the transfer. If either party disposes of their respective property before that two-year holding period elapses, the original exchange is retroactively disqualified, and both parties recognize the gain they had originally deferred, generally in the year of the early disposition. There are limited exceptions to the two-year requirement, including the death of either party before the period elapses, an involuntary conversion of the property such as a casualty loss or condemnation, or a situation where the taxpayer can affirmatively establish to the Internal Revenue Service that neither the original exchange nor the early disposition had tax avoidance as one of its principal purposes, which is a difficult standard to meet and rarely relied upon as a planning strategy. A particularly important trap involves related-party exchanges structured to move appreciated property to a related party who then quickly sells to an unrelated third party; even though the final sale involves an outside buyer, the Internal Revenue Service and courts have treated this pattern as an indirect cash-out through the related party, disqualifying the deferral. For ${PRIMARY_CITY}, ${PRIMARY_STATE_ABBR} investors considering an exchange within a family ownership structure, such as trading property between siblings or between an individual and a family-owned entity, we strongly recommend involving both a qualified intermediary and tax counsel early, since the related-party rules are fact-intensive and the penalty for missing the two-year holding requirement is full retroactive gain recognition for both parties involved. A separate but frequently confused concept is the drop-and-swap, where partners in a partnership that owns real property distribute their interests as tenants in common before an exchange so that individual partners can pursue different replacement strategies; this restructuring does not by itself create a related-party exchange, but it introduces its own timing and documentation requirements that are commonly evaluated alongside related-party planning because both issues tend to surface in family or closely held ownership structures.`,

If you eventually sell that property outside of another exchange, the deferred gain becomes taxable at that time.

        answer:
          "If you previously used the property as a rental and later converted it to your primary residence, you may still qualify for the exclusion once you meet the two-year ownership and use test, but the exclusion does not apply to gain allocable to periods of nonqualified use after 2008, such as the time it was rented before becoming your home. That portion of gain remains taxable even if you otherwise qualify, and calculating it correctly requires tracking your use history year by year.",

Section 121 excludes gain on a primary residence. Holding property until death can result in a stepped-up basis for heirs.

          "A Section 1031 exchange is the most widely used tool for real estate investors specifically, allowing you to defer both capital gains tax and depreciation recapture by exchanging relinquished property for like-kind replacement property held for investment or business use. It requires working with a qualified intermediary, meeting the 45-day identification deadline, and closing on replacement property within 180 days of selling the relinquished property.",

          "An installment sale does not reduce the total tax owed, but it spreads the recognition of gain across the years in which you actually receive payments from the buyer, rather than recognizing the entire gain in the year of sale. This can keep you in a lower tax bracket in any given year and delay when the tax is due, though interest income on the seller-financed note is also taxable as it is received.",

For example, a property with both personal and rental use might use the Section 121 exclusion on the personal portion and a 1031 exchange on the rental portion. An installment sale structure generally cannot be combined with a full 1031 exchange on the same proceeds in a straightforward way, since the exchange requires the qualified intermediary to control the funds, so combining strategies requires careful upfront planning with your advisors.",

The recipient generally takes your carryover basis, meaning they inherit the same low basis and will owe the deferred gain if they eventually sell, unless they hold it until their own death for a stepped-up basis or use their own 1031 exchange. Gifting can still be a useful estate planning tool, but it should not be viewed as a way to erase the underlying tax liability.",

A tenancy-in-common interest gives you direct, undivided fractional ownership of the real property itself alongside other co-owners, following the guidelines in Revenue Procedure 2002-22, and typically requires unanimous consent among co-owners for major decisions.

If it is not clear from the documents, ask the sponsor directly whether the investment is intended to be 1031 eligible, since sponsors offering DST or TIC structures typically market that fact explicitly.

Liquidity is also generally lower than direct ownership, since DST interests are not traded on a public exchange and typically involve a multi-year hold. With NNN property, tenant credit quality is the central risk, since your income depends on a single tenant continuing to perform under the lease.

        question: "Is real estate crowdfunding generally eligible for a 1031 exchange?",
        answer:
          "Generally not, because most crowdfunding platforms structure their offerings as membership interests in a limited liability company or shares in a fund that owns the property, which is an interest in an entity rather than a direct interest in the real property itself. Section 1031 requires the replacement property to be real property, so entity interests of this kind, even though the entity's only asset is real estate, typically do not qualify.",
      },
      {
        question: "Are there crowdfunding platforms that do offer 1031-eligible investments?",
        answer:
          "Yes, a subset of platforms specifically structure certain offerings as Delaware Statutory Trust interests, which the Internal Revenue Service treats as direct interests in real property under Revenue Ruling 2004-86 when the trust follows the required operating restrictions. These DST offerings are marketed distinctly from the platform's standard LLC or fund offerings, so the eligibility depends on which specific product within the platform you are considering, not the platform as a whole. Both DST offerings and standard crowdfunded equity may be securities, and we do not sell securities directly; we connect investors with licensed providers for any offering that interests them.",

        question: "What should I check before assuming a crowdfunding investment qualifies for my exchange?",

          "Review the offering circular or private placement memorandum to see whether you are purchasing a direct or beneficial interest in real property, as with a DST, or a membership or fund interest in an entity, as is typical for standard crowdfunding deals. If the documents are unclear, ask the platform directly whether the specific offering is structured to be 1031 eligible before you rely on it as part of your identification within the 45-day window.",

        question: "How does crowdfunding compare to a traditional DST offering in terms of minimum investment?",
        answer:
          "Crowdfunding platforms are often marketed around lower minimum investments than traditional DST sponsors, which can make them attractive for investors placing a smaller amount of exchange equity. However, the lower minimum does not change the underlying legal analysis of whether the specific offering is structured as a real property interest or an entity interest, which remains the determining factor for 1031 eligibility regardless of investment size.",

We do not endorse or project returns for any specific platform, but we do recommend reviewing the fee disclosures in the offering documents carefully, since fees directly affect the net income and proceeds an investor ultimately receives.",

Debt service coverage ratio measures NOI against your loan payment, a figure lenders scrutinize closely when underwriting a purchase.

An investor moving from a management-intensive residential rental into a triple net leased property might see more predictable, though not necessarily higher, cash flow due to lower operating expense volatility.

New financing at current interest rates can result in a different debt service payment than your prior loan, even at a similar loan amount, which directly affects your post-exchange cash flow and is a factor we model explicitly when comparing replacement property options.",

        answer:
          "Self storage demand in the region has been supported by population growth, smaller residential unit sizes in dense urban development, and businesses using storage for overflow inventory, while zoning restrictions and rising land costs have limited new facility development in several King and Snohomish county submarkets.

If a facility derives a very large share of its revenue from non-rental services, that structure should be reviewed carefully before relying on it as replacement property.",

        answer:
          "Agency financing, sourced through government-sponsored lenders that specialize in multifamily, often offers longer amortization periods, competitive interest rates, and higher leverage for stabilized, well-occupied properties compared to conventional bank financing. Conventional financing may offer more flexibility for value-add properties that do not yet meet agency occupancy or condition requirements, but often at a higher rate or lower leverage until the property stabilizes.",

          "A stabilized property generally has occupancy at or near market norms, rents at or close to market rate, and no material deferred maintenance, producing predictable current income. A value-add property typically has below-market rents, elevated vacancy, or deferred maintenance that a new owner plans to address through renovation and repositioning to increase income over time, which usually involves more active management and often more attractive but less certain returns.",

However, individual manufactured homes owned by the park operator and rented out to residents, if they are not permanently affixed to the land in a manner that makes them part of the real property under applicable state law, are typically treated as personal property, and personal property has not qualified for 1031 treatment since the 2017 tax law change.",
