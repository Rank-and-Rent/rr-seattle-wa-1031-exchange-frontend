    mainDescription: "<p>A partial exchange allows you to exchange a portion of your property value while taking cash boot. This structure is useful when you want to defer taxes on part of your gain while accessing cash from the sale. Partial exchanges result in partial tax deferral because the boot portion is taxable.</p><p>In Seattle, WA, partial exchanges follow standard exchange rules but you intentionally receive boot. The boot portion is subject to capital gains tax in the year received. The exchanged portion qualifies for tax deferral. You must still identify replacement property within forty five days and complete the purchase within one hundred eighty days for the exchanged portion.</p><p>This service includes boot calculation, Qualified Intermediary coordination, property identification support, exchange documentation, and compliance review. Partial exchanges work well for investors who need cash from the sale but want to defer taxes on the remaining portion. The tax consequences should be carefully evaluated with your tax advisor.</p>",

        question: "How is boot calculated in a partial exchange in Seattle, WA?",
        answer: "In Seattle, WA, boot in a partial exchange is the difference between the relinquished property value and the replacement property value, plus any cash received. If you sell a property for one million dollars and purchase replacement property for seven hundred thousand dollars, you have three hundred thousand dollars of boot. This boot is subject to capital gains tax.",
      },
      {
        question: "Can I take cash boot and still defer some taxes?",
        answer: "Yes, in Seattle, WA you can take cash boot and still defer taxes on the exchanged portion. If you sell for one million dollars and purchase replacement property for eight hundred thousand dollars, you defer taxes on eight hundred thousand dollars and pay taxes on two hundred thousand dollars of boot. This provides partial tax deferral while accessing cash.",
      },
      {
        question: "Do I still need to identify replacement property in a partial exchange?",
        answer: "Yes, in Seattle, WA you must still identify replacement property within forty five days and complete the purchase within one hundred eighty days for the exchanged portion. The identification and purchase requirements apply to the portion you are exchanging, not the boot portion. The boot portion does not require replacement property.",
      },
      {
        question: "What are the tax consequences of taking boot in a partial exchange?",
        answer: "In Seattle, WA, boot received in a partial exchange is subject to capital gains tax in the year received. You may also face depreciation recapture on the boot portion. The exchanged portion qualifies for tax deferral. It is important to calculate the tax impact with your tax advisor before structuring a partial exchange.",
      },
      {
        question: "Can I use a partial exchange to pay off debt?",
        answer: "In Seattle, WA, paying off debt with exchange proceeds can create boot if the debt on replacement property is less than the debt on relinquished property. This is known as mortgage boot. If you reduce your debt, that reduction is treated as boot and is taxable. Consult with your tax advisor about debt reduction strategies.",
      },
      {
        question: "Is a partial exchange better than selling and paying taxes?",
        answer: "In Seattle, WA, whether a partial exchange is better depends on your situation. Partial exchanges defer taxes on the exchanged portion while allowing you to access cash. Selling and paying taxes gives you immediate access to all proceeds but you pay taxes on the entire gain. Evaluate both options with your tax advisor based on your cash needs and tax situation.",
